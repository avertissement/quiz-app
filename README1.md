<h1>Quiz App Project</h1>
<p>For one of the most challenging projects I have ever done (thus far), I have made a quiz app, fully functional with appropriate design. While the JS code is some 370 lines long, I have painstankingly made sure every detail is accounted for. Please let me know of any recommendations you may have for me!</p>

<h2>Important Things to Note</h2>
<p>You will notice I made X a global variable. This is to ensure it is permanently changed as a user goes through the quiz, regardless of the scope in question. Also, you will notice I have many event listeners (likely more than necessary). However, I still chose to uphold their frequency because of time constraint.</p>

<p>Last, I did not include HTML wireframe files. I would normally do this, but I opted out of doing this at this particular time for various reasons.</p>
